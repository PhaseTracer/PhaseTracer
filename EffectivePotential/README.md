# Effective Potential

Library of effective potentials used for `PhaseTracer` and `BubbleProfiler`

To build with cmake:
    
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. DBUILD_WITH_EXAMPLE=1
    cmake --build .

This builds the `simplified_2d` and `Z2_scalar_singlet ` binaries under `bin/` and the shared object library `libeffectivepotential.so` under `lib/`
